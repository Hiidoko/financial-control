## üîç Product Overview
Users can:
1. Enter full financial profile (income, expenses, savings, taxes, bonuses, goals & scenario shocks).
2. Generate multi‚Äëscenario simulations (baseline / optimistic / pessimistic) + stress tests.
3. Receive structured recommendations (quick wins, cuts, strategic moves, risk mitigation, persona).
4. Adopt automatically suggested goals (ranked by priority & horizon).
5. Export data (PDF / CSV / Excel / ICS) ‚Äì consolidated PDF roadmap WIP.
6. Access Pro Suite: ANBIMA comparative report, collaborative goal planning, Open Finance snapshot (synthetic demo data).
7. Collapse/expand all panels with persistent state (localStorage) and smooth animation.
8. Switch dark/light theme and use focus mode for distraction‚Äëfree review.

## üöÄ Tech Stack
| Layer | Technologies |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite, Context API, custom hooks, Chart.js, html2canvas + jsPDF, SheetJS (XLSX) |
| Recommendation | TensorFlow.js lightweight model + rule enrichment |
| Exports | PDF (canvas), CSV / Excel, ICS (calendar events) |
| Backend | Node.js 20+, Express 4, Mongoose 8, JWT, bcryptjs, Zod validators |
| Security Baseline | JWT auth, password hashing, validation, CORS structure (rate limiting placeholder) |
| Build & DX | Concurrently, nodemon, dotenv, ESM, automatic frontend build fallback on server start |
| Tests | Vitest (backend core ‚Äì expansion planned) |

Performance niceties: lazy unmount of collapsed panels, height transitions, persisted UI preferences.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Multi‚Äëscenario wealth projection (timeline with events: bonuses, job loss months, unexpected expenses).
- Goal management (priority, horizon, progress, shortfall + delayed projection view).
- Auto recommended goals (profile heuristics).
- Recommendation engine panels: quick wins, expense cuts, strategic moves, risk scenarios, behavioral persona.
- ANBIMA comparative report (baseline vs optimistic vs pessimistic) ‚Äì initial iteration.
- Collaborative planning (suggested partner contributions to shared goals ‚Äì mock pipeline structure).
- Open Finance snapshot (synthetic accounts: volatility & liquidity coverage metrics).
- Exports: PDF (visual snapshot), CSV/Excel multi-sheet (timeline, goals, scenarios), ICS (goal milestone events).
- Simulation history with dual comparison & note taking.
- Universal collapsible panels (+/‚àí) with persistent state & animated height transitions.
- Responsive UI tuned for small devices (including iPhone SE width) and accessible focus flows.
- Dark/Light theme toggle & focus mode.

In progress: richer validation, upgraded recommendation model, consolidated multi‚Äësection PDF export, expanded test coverage.

## üß© Simulation Flow
1. User provides profile + goals + taxes + bonuses + expense breakdown.
2. Projection service builds monthly timeline & evaluates goal achievement (on‚Äëtime / delayed / shortfall).
3. Heuristic & ML hybrid layer produces recommendations and persona classification.
4. KPIs & comparative metrics feed charts, summaries, stress test impact and snapshot panels.
5. Exports package transforms normalized data into chosen formats.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup
Prerequisite: [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
```bash
# Install root, server and client deps
npm install
npm install --prefix server
npm install --prefix client

# Environment examples
cp .env.example .env
cp server/.env.example server/.env

# Dev (concurrent)
npm run dev
```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173  
API: http://localhost:4000

### Production Build / Integrated Serve
```bash
npm run build --prefix client
npm run build   # optional server-side steps if defined
npm run serve   # serve API + static client
```
The server searches `server/public`, then `client/dist` (or `CLIENT_DIST_PATH` override) to serve the SPA and prevent `Cannot GET /` issues.
